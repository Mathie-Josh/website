      <description>Vim needs no introduction.  Well that&amp;rsquo;s not entirely true, it probably does if you have never heard of it. vim or Vi IMproved, is a well known port of the vi editor created by Bill Joy, that was created by Bram Moolenaar. vim was designed as a more improved text editor over the original vi, with a heavy influence on the use of the keyboard over the mouse, and pre-installed movement commands, or custom macros, to traverse the document you are creating or editing.</description>

      <description>Today I would like to go through how I Installed Termux on my Android phone, how I edited the app, what applications I use it for, why I installed it, and what I have learned.
First What is Termux you might ask? Pulled directly form the main website https://www.termux.com:
 Termux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the APT package manager.</description>
